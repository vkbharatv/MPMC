# 8051/52 Microcontroller

MPMC contains compact example projects and C source code for experiments with 8051/8052 microcontrollers (Keil uVision projects).

Each example demonstrates a small embedded system concept such as driving an LCD with ADC input, controlling a seven-segment display, and using timers to drive motors. The repository includes source files, Keil project files, and build artifacts to help you study or reproduce the experiments.

Repository structure (high level):

- `LCD_ADC/` — LCD examples and ADC interfacing (Keil project files and sources)
- `Seven_seg/` — Seven-segment display demos and project files
- `Timer_with_Motors/` — Timer-based motor control examples
- `interrupt8051/` - 8051/52 interrupts explanation with an example.

Feel free to open any folder to see the code and Keil project settings for each experiment.
